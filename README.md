# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sebastian, a Data Engineering student by day and a beer enthusiast by night.
When not putting my frustration on my rubber ducky, you'll find me either brewing beer, engaging in epic board game battles, or relaxing in the sauna after a thrilling day on the ski slopes.
I'm the type of person who's ready to invest a solid 10 hours into a project just to trim off 5 precious seconds from a task.
